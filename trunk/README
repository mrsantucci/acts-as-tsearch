== Welcome to the TSearch demo app

To get this up and running do the following

create a database:
	> createdb tsearch_development 

Fill in the blanks in database.yml

	development:
	  adapter: postgresql
	  database: tsearch_development
	  username: 
	  password: 
	  host: localhost

Setup the db with tsearch2.  Try the dbsetup.sh script or see http://code.google.com/p/acts-as-tsearch/ for instructions if that doesn't work.

	> chmod 755 dbsetup.sh
	> sudo ./dbsetup.sh tsearch_development whatever-your-db-username-is

Do a 
	> rake db:migrate

You might also need the feedtools gem for this demo...

	> sudo gem install feedtools
	

Hopefully that's it.  Let me know if you run into problems so we can make it better for the next person.
