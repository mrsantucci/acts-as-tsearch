= Sample Project = 

I recently added a sample project to help you get started (and help me work out kinks in the code).  Just grab the whole project with a
{{{
mkdir tsearch
cd tsearch
svn export --force http://acts-as-tsearch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ .
}}}

and read the README.

For the plugin only - directions below...

= Introduction =

After you've [PreparingYourPostgreSQLDatabase set-up your database] follow these quick steps to get up and running.  See [AdvancedSearching advanced searching] for doing more complex work.

== Get the plugin ==

{{{
ruby script/plugin install http://acts-as-tsearch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vendor/plugins/acts_as_tsearch
}}}

== Add acts_as_tsearch to a model ==

{{{
class BlogEntry < ActiveRecord::Base
   acts_as_tsearch :fields => ["title","description"]
end
}}}

== Do a search ==

blog_entries = BlogEntry.find_by_tsearch("bob")
puts blog_entries.tsearch_rank
