#summary Migration notes when using find_by_tsearch


TSearch will create indexes for your table the first time you search but, that's not really practical if you have really large tables.  

First - this is what a sample migration table def looks like:
{{{
    create_table :blog_entries do |t|
      t.column "title",       :string
      t.column "summary",     :text
      t.column "link",        :string
      t.column "vectors",     :tsvector      
    end
}}}

If you wanted to update the vectors (search indexes) you'd just do:
{{{
BlogEntry.create_vector  #doesn't hurt to try, even if it exists
BlogEntry.update_vector
}}}
